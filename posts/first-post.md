Welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹

The purpose of this blog is to provide a space for me to express thoughts, opinions, and learnings as I try to become a better software developer. Writing these pieces provides potential value for those who visit **and** serves as reference for future me to reflect.

If you come across information that seems wrong or want to open discussion on anything you can reach me on Twitter ([@therealkevinzoo](https://twitter.com/therealkevinzoo)) and I'll respond!

For now let's go over the process of how I created this site.

## How this site was built
This site was created with Next.js and deployed (for free) on Vercel. I followed the guide at https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app, which is intuitive enough to complete even if I didn't have React experience. The dyanmic routes and static generation features of Next.js are great to work with, and I am excited to learn more about the framework.

I'm no designer, but Figma is my tool of choice when I want to express my passion for graphic design. The design was kept simple for two reasons:d
- removing distractions from content to keep the experience straightforward
- a lack of experience and knowledge in doing anything more complicated

The most complex "design choice" I made in the last iteration of my personal site was slide animations after the page finished loading (seen below). Truthfully I wanted to learn about libraries like Three.js and leverage those for a wow factor, but that will have to be shelved for a future iteration of this site.

Now I can focus on writing good and meaningful content, which is the exact reason I started this blog!
